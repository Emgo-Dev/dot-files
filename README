# Emgo Linux Notes

Welcome, this repo is a collection of notes, and things I use on Linux and in the terminal. You might notice the only files in the earl commits are prefixed with a '.'. I use these bash scripts in my root directory and prefer to keep them hidden.

## Kodi Controls

Have you ever heard of Kodi? It's a media player I am fond of. They want to bring the family-room/movie-theatre experience to your computer. They feature full-screen UI with a cinematic feel. Targeting this TV like experience, mouse inputs are generally a hassle to perform, instead you navigate the UI with arrow keys, and various contextual keys, as you would with a remote controller. This file is an attempt to document those various keys and what they do.

## Re-Bashrc

```
$ bash .rebashrc.sh
```

This bash script will reinitialize your '~/.bashrc' file. One of the things this file contains is your aliases - you can read more about aliases under the bash manual page (`$ man bash`).

## Reset Wifi [service/systemctl]

I use these bash scripts to reset the network adapter on my laptop, which sometimes stalls when I do not turn it off frequently. There are two files, each use a different method and I am not entirely sure there is a difference. I must have had a problem with one of them one day and found another method.
