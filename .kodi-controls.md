# Seeking

Seeking is an action that progressively scans forward or backward through a video. This action is bound to several of the default keyboard keys. It should be noted that seeking behaves slightly different depending on the key used. For example seeking with the up and down arrow keys or the [ and ] keys performs an immediate increment/decrement of twenty-five seconds; however using the left and right arrow keys will initiate an increment/decrement of ten seconds which takes effect after a short delay (one second) and will increase to twice its' current value for each sequential event trigger (key-press or autofire from holding the key)  detected before the event fires.

Seeking can be done with the following keys:

- right arrow: increments by ten seconds and doubles for each sequential trigger
- left arrow: decrements by ten seconds and doubles for each sequential trigger
- up arrow: increments by twenty-five seconds
- down arrow: decrements by twenty-five seconds
- left bracket: increments by twenty-five seconds
- right bracket: decrements by twenty-five seconds

# Full Screen

Full-screen may be toggled with the backslash key ('\'). Though the program is scaled to operate at full-screen or 1:1 aspect ratio regardless.

# Media Control Bar

This bar displays playback controls for the currently playing media. The bars display may be toggled with the 'm' key; which will also display the 'Now Playing' bar. If the bar is currently displayed, it may also be closed by pressing backspace. Note that pressing backspace while the bar is hidden and the video in play is in unobstructed view will instead display the playlist/folder view.

# Media Now Playing Bar

This bar displays playback progress for the currently playin media, as well as some information related to the media itself (video resolution, language, opus?, 2.0?). This bar may be toggled with the 'i' key. This bar is displayed in addition to the "Control Bar" when the 'm' key is pressed however pressing 'i' will not hide it when it is summoned this way, instead use the 'm' or backspace key to close the bars.

# System Menu

A system menu may be toggled with the 's' key. This menu features some commands related to system management such as closing the software, shutdown, suspend, timed shutdown, reboot, or logging off.

# Audio Offset

The audio playback of the currently playing media may be offset forward or backward by up to ten seconds. This prompt may be displayed by pressing the 'a' key and closed with backspace. This offset does not persiste across playback of multiple media files. Once the prompt is displayed, use the left and right arrow keys to increment/decrement the offset by 0.025 seconds per trigger. The prompt may be closed and reopend while the current media is still playing and further incremented/decremented from the last offset point.

# Fastfoward/Rewind

The playback speed of the currently playing media may be increased in a foward or reverse direction by multipliers of two for each event trigger up to a thirty-two playback speed multiplier. Rewinding may be triggered with the 'r' key and fastforwarding with the 'f' key. These triggers only activate while the video is in 'play' and performing one operation while the opposite event is in progress will decrement/increment that current multiplier. Pausing the video will reset the multiplier. There is no audio playback while either event is firing.

# Directory/Playlist Navigator

A window allowing navigation of files directories may be toggled with the tab key; unlike other bars, this window will not close with backspace, instead backspace is used to quickly navigate to a parent directory all the way up to the home menu. While this window is displayed, a side-bar window may be toggled with the left and right arrow keys. This side-bar window provides further display options.

Pressing the esc key while the window is in view will quickly jump to the home menu.

# Context Menu

The context menu provides file specific options for the currently selected media in the directory navigator. Pressing 'c' will display the menu and may be used to mark, queue for playlist, or favorite. The window may be hidden by pressing the 'c' key again, or with backspace while it is displayed. Menu items may be navigated with the up and down arrow keys.

# Volume Bar

There is a volume control for the media player which may be incremented/decremented with the + and - keys. The bar will hide itself after a short delay.

# Zoom

Zoom, display, or aspect ratio switching of for the playback of the current media may be toggled through with the 'z' key. Unsure whether this persists across multiple media files.

# Stop Playback

Playback of the currently selected media file may be aborted with the 'x' key. This will not only stop the file but remove of from the background display opening up the directory navigator.

# Mute/Unmute

The f8 key will mute/unmute the audio playback.
